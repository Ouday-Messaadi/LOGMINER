   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Similarity search (top-k retrieval)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assemble context dictionary
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Construct enriched prompt

3. Generation
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LLM processes prompt + context
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generate recommendations
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Parse and format response

## üìö Real-World Application

**Example Scenario:**
```
Error Log Detected:
ERROR: Database connection timeout after 30s
Service: payment-api | Host: prod-server-03

LogMiner Response:
1. Retrieved: 3 similar historical incidents
2. Root Cause: Database maintenance window pattern
3. Recommendations:
   - Check database server status: `systemctl status postgresql`
   - Verify connection pool: `psql -c "SHOW max_connections"`
   - Increase timeout threshold in config
4. Prevention: Schedule maintenance notifications
5. Estimated Resolution Time: 5-10 minutes
